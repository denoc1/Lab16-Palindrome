# Lab16-Palindrome Checker

A palindrome is a word that is read the same forward and backward.

You will create a program that asks the user for a “word” or phrase (string of characters) and returns a response whether the “word” or phrase is a palindrome or not.

**Optional Bonus**
Have the user enter a phrase, and ignoring spaces and case, have the program determine if it is a palindrome. (Punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored.)
Examples of sentence palindromes:
    Mr. Owl ate my metal worm.
    Do geese see God?
    Was it a car or a cat I saw?

Requirements:
